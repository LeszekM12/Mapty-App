## ⚙️ Running Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone
git clone https://github.com/LeszekM12/Mapty-App.git
cd Mapty-App

# 2. Install dependencies (TypeScript compiler)
npm install

# 3. Compile TypeScript
npx tsc

# 4. Serve (HTTPS or localhost required for Geolocation + Push)
npx serve .
# or
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

> ⚠️ The **Geolocation API**, **Push Notifications** and **Service Worker** all require **HTTPS** or `localhost`. Opening `index.html` directly via `file://` will not work.

---

## 🚀 Deployment (GitHub Pages)

The app is deployed automatically from the `main` branch:

1. Compiled `dist/` is committed alongside source
2. GitHub Pages serves from root `/`
3. Live at **[leszekm12.github.io/Mapty-App](https://leszekm12.github.io/Mapty-App/)**

Push notifications require the **[mapty-backend](https://mapty-backend-lexb.onrender.com)** — a separate Node.js server hosted on Render that handles VAPID key management and `/push/subscribe`, `/push/send` endpoints.
